It’s October 2016 and GameCo’s executive board is planning the marketing budget for 2017. They’re assuming that sales for the various geographic regions have stayed the same over time, and they’ve asked you to look into the data to see if this is still true. If it’s not, the marketing budget will need to be redistributed among the regions to maximize return on investment. While GameCo’s executives have an awareness of the video games market for different regions, they don’t have a deep understanding of the data. That’s why they’re looking to you to guide them through the results in a way that will be meaningful to them.
